            Close your eyes and imagine you're logging into your session, like 
            any other day, when suddenly, you realize one thing : your background 
            is still the same default classic Windows wallpaper.

            to bring you a relaxing vibe while working. But finding free 
            high-quality wallpapers that matches your needs is difficult : 
            sometimes there are no nature wallpapers, or the images, GIFS and 
            videos you found have a low quality. Hence, it's understandable to 
            see you going crazy behind your screen.

        <h1>Nature Dream Wallpapers | IaaS Licence Choice</h1>
        <p>
            For the project needs, IaaS providers are more interesting than SaaS, PaaS and 
            physical server hosting. Among all the IaaS providers, AWS EC2 stood out as a 
            relatively cheap, yet effective and reliable service, among some IaaS providers 
            like Microsoft Azure and Digital Ocean. That is the reason AWS EC2 was chosen to 
            host the website.
